// Chams: overrides the material of player/local meshes inside the scene-system
// GeneratePrimitives hook. Two independent passes -- "occluded" (through walls,
// depth disabled) and "visible" (depth tested) -- each with its own material style
// and colour. Applied to four independent targets (enemies, teammates, local arms,
// local weapon viewmodel). The custom materials are built once from embedded KV3
// (.vmat) buffers and shared across targets; only the colour differs per draw.
//
// GeneratePrimitives fires once per animatable scene object (a whole pawn / arms /
// weapon), with the object -- and therefore its owner -- resolved at natural
// granularity. This is what fixes the flicker: unlike the old DrawObject hook, which
// fired per low-level mesh part and had to reconstruct a churny owner pointer for
// each, here the owner is stable per object, so no TTL hysteresis / subtree walking
// is needed to bridge animation-driven scene-graph churn.
